		<h3>Vitaco Health Australia Pty Ltd<br>
		August 2010 - Present<br>
		Senior Graphic Designer / Production Manager</h3>

		<p>As the sole designer across 7 brands, Aussie Bodies, Healtheries, Balance Sports Nutrition, Wagner, Bodytrim, Abundant Earth and Musashi my primary task has been taking a design from briefing to design and then into production. The majority of my work has been in the FMCG space with brand such as Aussie Bodies, Healtheries, Bodytrim and Abundant Earth. Working closely with brand managers taking their ideals and making them into exciting usable functional products. On any day my work can vary from trade promotion design, packaging, art directing photoshoots, outdoor and online campaigns development including html5 and flash as well as social media engagement. Many of the brands are sold into different countries like China and Saudi Arabia so each market presents different design challenges which I have to overcome. Being a sole designer has many challenges including the ability to adapt, manage many projects at different stages of production and prioritising jobs.</p>
